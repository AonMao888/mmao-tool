{"title":"CUPP","cate":"Wordlist Generator","des":"The most common form of authentication is the combination of a username and a password or passphrase. If both match values stored within a locally stored table, the user is authenticated for a connection. Password strength is a measure of the difficulty involved in guessing or breaking the password through cryptographic techniques or library-based automated testing of alternate values.
A weak password might be very short or only use alphanumberic characters, making decryption simple. A weak password can also be one that is easily guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday, nickname, address, name of a pet or relative, or a common word such as God, love, money or password.
That is why CUPP was born, and it can be used in situations like legal penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.","cmd":"apt update ; apt install git -y ; git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git ; cd cupp ; $ python3 cupp.py -h","icon":"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/96784636cb266799e64db456cda569d6298a9ecd5abe64b0ce92156eea76989b/Mebus/cupp/issues/53"}
